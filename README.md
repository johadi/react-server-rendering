### REACT SERVER SIDE RENDERING
This project is to simply demonstrate the concept of building Isomorphic app using React
server side rendering.

#### SECTIONS
The project is divided into different sections and each section demonstrates some level of
concept. For every section is an associated tag. This allows you to see how
the project is able to be developed from one level to the other.

#### Version 1

Version 1 is just an introduction to server side rendering using react. server side complex concepts are
demonstrated in higher versions. Here are what this version 1 entails.

- ExpressJS with NodeJS for server side implementation
- React on the server side for rendering and on the client side for client side implementation.
- React Router on the server side and client side for navigation
- Redux `(and react-redux)` on the server side and client side for state management
- `async-error-handler` for handing errors in async functions.

#### Version 2

Version two just abstracts the react router routes to a separate file. This makes the routes reusable between the server
and the client side. It also allows us to perform some complex logic which makes the state rendered from the server more
predictable.
